# Parser

A simple parser for a language with C-style syntax.

What's supported:
- Comments
- Constants and variables
- Number arithmetic and boolean arithmetic (lazy evaluation)
- Strong, static typing
- Type casting
- If + While + For
- "Guard" operation allowing to change a variable into a const in its scope (value modification results in runtime error)
- Ternary expressions
- Print to screen
- Functions with value returns
- Pass by reference and value
- Recursion
- Anonymous functions
- Function nesting
- "compile-time" type evaluation
